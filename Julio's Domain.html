<center><h2>Biography</h2></center>
<center><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm currently enrolled in Tech Foundry to further my knowledge in the IT field.  Working towards becoming a Data Architect thats my end goal career.  I'm from the Dominican Republic and I've been living in the United States for over twenty years now.  I have mostly worked in the retail channel therefore all my working experience has been with direct customer interaction.  My most recent jobs were with Radioshack that was my intro into the technology world because I had to learn a lot about cables and routers and all kinds of connections to make computers and home networks work.  After this I moved to Verizon Wireless and started learning about wireless technology that ranged from a single cell phone to units to connect machine to machine equipment such as trackers for vehicles and other security devices.
